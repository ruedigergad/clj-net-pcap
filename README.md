# clj-net-pcap
clj-net-pcap is a wrapper/adapter/facade (No matter how you want to call it.) around [jNetPcap](http://jnetpcap.com/) that enables and eases packet capturing with [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

## Requirements/Dependencies
clj-net-pcap is currently available for Linux and Windows for both x86 and x86_64 architecture.

Please note that clj-net-pcap requires native packet capturing libraries.
For Linux, this is the [libpcap](http://www.tcpdump.org/) library.
For Windows, this is the [winpcap](http://www.winpcap.org/) library.
Typically, these libraries have to be installed separately.
On Linux, this is usually done via the packet manager of the respective distribution.

When using clj-net-pcap via Leiningen or Maven, all Java/Clojure related dependencies should be resolved and pulled in automatically.

Additionally, please note that on Linux clj-net-pcap expects the libpcap library to be named "libpcap.so".
If this is not the case this can be fixed by, e.g., adding a symbolic link like shown for Fedora below:

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libpcap.so.1 /usr/lib64/libpcap.so

## Usage
clj-net-pcap is primarily intended as a library that is used by other applications.
However, it can be run as sample stand-alone command line application as follows:

java -jar clj-net-pcap-standalone-jar-file.jar

For more information about the available options use the "-h" or "--help" option.

## Publications
We published two papers in which we describe the clj-net-pcap architecture and implementation and assess the performance:

* Improving Network Traffic Acquisition and Processing with the Java Virtual Machine, Ruediger Gad, Martin Kappes, and Inmaculada Medina-Bulo, 20th IEEE ISCC 2015, in press
    * [The full text of the authors accepted version is available via ResearchGate.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289637876_Improving_Network_Traffic_Acquisition_and_Processing_with_the_Java_Virtual_Machine)
    * The link to the final published version on IEEEXplore will be added once it is available.

## Building etc.
clj-net-pcap uses Leiningen.
Please note that Leiningen version 2.x is used.

## History & Acknowledgements
clj-net-pcap was created and is still developed and maintained as a personal project.
However, I am in the fortunate situation that it showed after some time that clj-net-pcap could also be used for my PhD and research work.
While I did the actual development in my spare time, I worked on the scientific evaluation of clj-net-pcap and published these results in scientific papers in scope of my employment as PhD student and researcher.
Consequently, acknowledgements go to my employer the [Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences](http://frankfurt-university.de) and the [Universidad de CÃ¡diz](http://uca.es) where I am currently enrolled as PhD student.

While the project name was initially "cljNetPcap", it was renamed to "clj-net-pcap" in order to adhere to common package naming conventions.
Furthermore, I decided to upload clj-net-pcap to [clojars.org](http://clojars.org) in order to ease its application.
