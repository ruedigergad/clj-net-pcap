<h1><a name="into">Introduction</a></h1>

<p><em>jNetPcap</em> is a java wrapper around <em>libpcap</em> and <em>WinPcap</em>
native libraries found on various unix and windows platforms. <em>jNetPcap</em>
exposes the functionality as a java programming interface (API) which
this documentation describes.
<p><b> Feature highlights:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Follows native <em>libpcap</em> programming model. This makes
	learning <em>jNetPcap</em> API easy.</li>
	<li><b> No packet buffer copies between <em>libpcap</em> and
	java space. </b>Existing native in-memory buffer is wrapped inside a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code>
	object with not data copies.</li>
	<li>Low level and efficient JNI implementation.</li>
	<li>Provides some very low level functions previously not
	available in Java space. i.e. <code>setBuffer</code> for changing
	buffer size on windows platform and others.</li>
	<li>Packet decoding and protocol analysis using stateful analyzers</li>
	<li>An extensible library of protocols</li>
</ul>
The API follows the C
<em>libpcap</em>
counter part very closely in order to expose all of the functionality
and even quirks of
<em>libpcap</em>
. For example old style integer status codes are returned and
warning/error messages are filled into a java
<code>StringBuilder</code>
buffer and no java exceptions are thrown outside the usual
mismatched/invalid arguments.

<h2><a name="quick_start">Quick start</a></h2>

The starting place is to read over the
<a href="org/jnetpcap/Pcap.html">Pcap.class</a>
documentation and
<a href="org/jnetpcap/package-summary.html">org.jnetpcap</a>
package overview. There are several examples there to show the reader
how to utilize
<em>jNetPcap</em>
java library. Make sure that you have the
<em>libpcap</em>
library installed. On
<em>windows</em>
platforms that would be the
<em>WinPcap</em>
driver and on unix systems one of
<em>libpcap</em>
or
<em>libpcap-dev</em>
depending on exact flavor of unix. Lastly follow the installation
instructions carefully to make sure that native
<em>jnetpcap</em>
shared C library is installed in the proper place.

<h1><a name="connection">Project website and the native <em>libpcap</em>
connection</a></h1>

<p>Since <em>jNetPcap</em> is very closely mapped to native <em>libpcap</em>
library functions, users are encouraged to read <em>libpcap</em>
documentation at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump"><em>libpcap</em>
on wikipedia</a> and visit <em>libpcap</em>'s homepage at <a
	href="http://tcpdump.org">http://tcpdump.org</a>. You can also visit <em>jNetPcap</em>
project website for more information and a user guide with tutorials at
<a href="http://jnetpcap.org">http://jnetpcap.org</a> .</p>

<h2><a name="native_libpcap"><em>libpcap</em> native library</a></h2>

<p>Pcap (which stands for <u>P</u>acket <u>Cap</u>ture) is an
application programming interface for packet capturing from a live
network interface. The implementation of pcap for Unix-like systems is
known as <em>libpcap</em>; the Windows port of <em>libpcap</em> is
called <em>WinPcap</em>. <em>libpcap</em> and <em>WinPcap</em> may be
used by a program to capture packets traveling over a network and, in
newer versions, to transmit packets on a network at the link layer, as
well as to get a list of network interfaces that can be used with <em>libpcap</em>
or <em>WinPcap</em>. <em>libpcap</em> and <em>WinPcap</em> are the
packet capture and filtering engines of many open source and commercial
network tools, including protocol analyzers, network monitors, network
intrusion detection systems, packet sniffers, traffic generators and
network testers. The pcap API is designed for use from C and C++, so,
for other languages such as scripting languages, Java, and .NET
languages, a wrapper is generally used. (<em>Credit: wikipedia.org</em>)</p>

<h2><a name="native_winpcap"><em>WinPcap</em> windows <em>libpcap</em>
implementation</a></h2>

<em>WinPcap</em>
consists of:
<ul>
	<li>drivers for Windows 95/98/Me, and for the Windows NT family
	(Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows
	Vista, etc.), that use NDIS to read packets directly from a network
	adapter</li>

	<li>implementations of a lower-level library for those OSes, to
	communicate with those drivers</li>

	<li>a port of <em>libpcap</em> that uses the API offered by the
	low-level library implementations. It was originally created at the
	Politecnico di Torino. Now it's maintained by CACE Technologies, a
	company created by some of the <em>WinPcap</em> developers.</li>

<h1><a name="about_wrapper">About <em>jNetPcap</em> a java
wrapper</a></h1>

<b><em>jNetPcap</em></b>
is a java wrapper based on both
<em>libpcap</em>
and
<em>WinPcap</em>
.
<em>jNetPcap</em>
's API provides core implementation based on unix
<em>libpcap</em>
API library (
<code>org.jnetpcap</code>
) while also providing the
<em>WinPcap</em>
extra functionality as an extension (
<code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap</code>
). The main classes which implement
<em>libpcap</em>
and
<em>WinPcap</em>
functionality are:
<ul>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.Pcap</code> class - core <em>libpcap</em>
	methods available on all platforms</li>
	<li><code>org.jnetpcap.winpcap.winpcap</code> class - extensions
	based on <em>WinPcap</em> library typically only available on windows
	based system</li>
</ul>
The core
<em>libpcap</em>
implementation of
<em>jNetPcap</em>
, provides methods to do the following functions
<ul>
	<li>Find a complete list of network interfaces the system has</li>
	<li>Open either a network interface or a PCAP capture file for
	reading packets</li>
	<li>Apply a packet filter</li>
	<li>Dump packets into a PCAP capture file</li>
	<li>Transmit raw link layer packets over a network interface</li>
	<li>Gather statistics on network interface and report counters</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="implementation_notes"><em>jNetPcap</em>
implementation notes</a></h2>

Without disclosing too much technical implementation detail, here is a
little description of how
<em>jNetPcap</em>
is implemented in general.
<em>jNetPcap</em>
on the java side, is made up of several java classes. These classes are
peered with native C structures provided by libpcap. So for example when
you retrieve an instance of
<code>Pcap</code>
object, the object contains a memory pointer to a C pcap_t structure.
When any non-static method call on the java class, will use the stored
reference to the native C structure to execute the requested function.
Same thing applies to all other structures such as
<code>PcapIf</code>
and the remaining. They are all peered and retain a memory reference to
their corresponding C structure. For safety purposes and java
protections, the reader is not allowed to access these C structures
directly and all the comparible
<em>libpcap</em>
library functions are provided as java methods. Therefore the is a very
close relationshipt between each java object and its corresponding
native C strucutre, the same applies to
<em>libpcap</em>
functions and their corresponding java methods.

<h3><a name="implementation_multithreading">Multithreading
support</a></h3>

<p>The native <em>libpcap</em> library is not multithread safe. It
does not support reentrant function calls from multiple threads. <em>jNetPcap</em>
wrapper does not provide any addition multithreading support than what
is provided by <em>libpcap</em> itself.</p>
<p>It is however safe to interact with various <code>Pcap</code>
objects from multiple threads, as long as access is externally
synchronized.</p>

<h4>Pseudo code example: Breaking out of <code>Pcap.loop()</code>
using 2 threads</h4>
(
<b>Weblink:</b>
<a
	href="http://jnetpcap.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jnetpcap/trunk/tests/java/org/jnetpcap/TestOpenCloseMultiThreaded.java?view=markup">link
to a complete example.</a>
)
<p>The following example demonstrates, using pseudo code, how to
capture packets from network interface in one thread while providing
control of the capture session from another thread. The example
specifically shows the neccessary synchronization needed to break a
capture loop from another thread and closing the capture session. Thread
#1 is a control thread and Thread #2 is the packet capture loop thread.</p>

<i>Thread #1 - control thread</i>

<pre style="border: 1px;">
_start Thread #2
_receive Pcap object reference from Thread #2 
_issue Pcap.breakLoop call
_wait for Thread #2 to exit
_issue Pcap.close call
_goto start
</pre>

<i>Thread #2 - open live capture and loop thread</i>

<pre style="border: "1px;>
_issue Pcap.findAllDevs and retrieve all network devices
_issue Pcap.openLive using one of the network devices
_create PcapHandler, a callback object for the Pcap.loop, user data is Pcap object
_issue Pcap.loop call with our PcapHandler, Thread #2 control is passed to libpcap

// In Thread #2 libpcap supplies buffers to our PcapHandler
// On first call to PcapHandler, we exchange Pcap object with Thread #1
// One possible implementation of the exchange is java.util.concurrent.Exchanger
</pre>
<p>In the above example, once Thread #1 issues a <code>Pcap.breakLoop()</code>
call, the loop in Thread #2 may not terminate immediately. Exactly how
the loop terminates is native <em>libpcap</em> library dependent. You
can see <a
	href="http://jnetpcap.com/docs/javadoc/jnetpcap-1.1-javadoc/index.html">Pcap.breakLoop()</a>
javadoc page for more specific implementation details. Thread #1 must
then wait for Thread #2 to break out of the loop and gracefully exit.
The wait can be accomplished using <code>java.lang.Thread.join()</code>
method on Thread #2 object reference. Once Thread #2 exits, it is safe
to call <code>Pcap.close()</code> on the exchanged <code>Pcap</code>
object.</p>
<p><b>Note #1:</b> it is imperative to wait for Thread #2 to exit,
or some other way of synchronization, to ensure that Thread #2 has
broken out of the <code>Pcap.loop()</code> otherwise a premature call to
<code>Pcap.close()</code> while Thread #2 is still in the loop will
cause a coredump and the entire Java VM to crash. The coredump or crash
stems from the fact that <em>libpcap</em> is not multithreaded and a
single threaded execution is assumed. In a single thread, it is
impossible to issue a <code>Pcap.close()</code> at the same time <code>Pcap.loop()</code>
is still executing, since a <code>Pcap.loop()</code> is a blocking call.</p>
<p><b>Note #2:</b>As a convenience, starting with version 1.2,
jNetPcap provides 2 methods to run loops in a background thread. The
methods are found in the <code>Pcap</code> and <code>PcapUtils</code>
classes. The names are <code>dispatchInBackground()</code> and <code>loopInBackground()</code>.
These methods return a <code>PcapTask</code> handle which allows the
user to interact with the background thread such as aquire error codes
and issue <code>breakLoop</code> safely to terminate any background
tasks nicely.</p>


<h2><a name="winpcap_extension"><em>jNetPcap</em>'s <em>WinPcap</em>
extension</a></h2>

<em>WinPcap</em>
library from
<a href="http://winpcap.org">http://winpcap.org</a>
, provides support for all of the core
<em>libpcap</em>
functions as well as, numerous functions that are not part of the core
<em>libpcap</em>
functionality and are only available on platforms that support
<em>WinPcap</em>
. These extra functions greatly enhance
<em>libpcap</em>
calls, and generally don't provide features not found in the core. They
simply provide enhanced versions of the functions that are more
efficient or provide greater control over lets say the behavior of the
NPF driver within a windows kernel. This is great news for windows
platforms.

<h3><a name="checking_winpcap">Checking for <em>WinPcap</em>
extension support</a></h3>

Since java can be run on nearly any platform and
<em>WinPcap</em>
extensions are only available on certain platforms (i.e. windows based
platforms), the user must check first if the extension is available
before using it. The check is done using a static method call
<code>WinPcap.isSupported()</code>
which will return a boolean value. Returned value of
<code>true</code>
means that the extension is supported otherwise
<code>false</code>
.
<em>WinPcap</em>
extension can not be used on a platform that does not support the
extension. Any method used with
<code>WinPcap</code>
on an unsupported platform, will throw an immediate unchecked
<code>PcapExtensionNotAvailableException</code>
, to indicate that this extension is not available on this particular
platform. Therefore, it is very important to always do a check first
before relying on an extension function (i.e. org.jnetpcap.winpcap.)

<h1><a name="packet_framework">Packet decoding</a></h1>
Packets can be decoded using the included "packet decoding framework".
The frame work resides in
<code>org.jnetpcap.packet</code>
package and provides limited decoding capabilities. A
<code>JPacketHandler</code>
dispatcher handler is used with
<code>Pcap.loop(), Pcap.dispatch()</code>
methods which receives JPacket objects. JPackets are fully decoded
packets and provide a packet API that allows the user to query which
protocol headers exist in the packet and access those headers. Each
header then provides a method for each network header field found in the
header and any logic that goes into decoding that protocol header.
<p>Various formatters are also provided which allow a packet to be
reformatted to various textual forms such as a plain text that is human
readable and less human readable Xml format which is great for computer
applications.</p>
<p>jNetPcap is supplied with a core set of protocol headers, but the
list is not complete. The API provides a mechanism for extending and
adding additional protocols to the framework. Protocol header
contributions are welcome.</p>

<h1><a name="other_extensions">Other extensions?</a></h1>

<p>Currently no other extensions are supported, but can easily be
added once suitable candidates are found such as <em>AirPcap</em> from <a
	href="http://cacetech.com">http://cacetech.com</a> , as long licensing
terms permit it.</p>
<small>Note: currently there are no plans to support <em>AirPcap</em>
as an extension. The name was arbitrarily chosen as an example of
another <em>libpcap</em> extension.</small>

<h1><a name="requirements">Java requirements</a></h1>

Requires the binary
<em>libpcap</em>
,
<em>libpcap-dev</em>
or
<em>WinPcap</em>
packages to be installed, as appropriate for each platform, on any given
system (downloadable from
<a href="http://winpcap.org"><em>WinPcap</em> website</a>
or appropriate package repository for unix systems.) jUnit tests are
distributed in source form found in the
<em>tests/java</em>
directory. No compiled classes are currently supplied of jUnit tests
with the binary release. Any
<a href="junit.org">jUnit library</a>
is sufficient to compile and run all jUnit test cases. Build environment
requires ANT, ANT's contrib
<a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net">cpptasks</a>
, and a C++ compiler. Currently
<em>jNetPcap</em>
compiles using
<a href="http://mingw.org">MinGW</a>
gcc compiler and environment on win32 platform and under regular gnu
gcc/g++ on linux. No
<em>Makefiles</em>
are used nor required.

<h1><a name="other_wrappers">Other java <em>libpcap</em>
wrappers</a></h1>

<p>Here is a little introduction to other java wrappers (unrelated
to <em>jNetPcap</em>), in order to clear up the confusion between
various like sounding projects in relation to a java wrapper for native
<em>libpcap</em>. The <em>jNetPcap</em> is completely independent
project from all other java <em>libpcap</em> wrappers. The names of the
projects may sound similar but the implementation and goals of each
project were much different.</p>
<p>Two non related projects that <em>jNetPcap</em> team is aware of
are both named the same <b>jPcap</b> and they both provide two different
APIs and implementations. Please see each project's website for more
detail:
<ul>
	<li>jPcap on SourceForge: <a href="http://jpcap.sourceforge.net">homepage</a></li>
	<li>jPcap by Mr. Keita Fujii: <a
		href="http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/jpcap/doc/">homepage</a>
</ul>
<p>(<b>Note:</b> for the most upto date list of all wrappers for <em>libpcap</em>
library look at <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libpcap#Wrappers_for_use_of_libpcap.2FWinPcap_in_languages_other_than_C_and_C.2B.2B">Wikipedia
webpage for libpcap</a> .)</p>
Both of
<em>jPcap</em>
projects provide some kind of packet decoding facility, but are limited
on the
<em>libpcap</em>
features they expose. Starting with release 1.2,
<em>jNetPcap</em>
also provides limited packet decoding capabilities. If you require
higher level API that is object oriented, follows java programming
paradigm, provides full packet decoding and capture file manipulation,
we also recommend
<a href="http://jnetstream.org"><em>jNetStream</em></a>
, a sister project, that is built on top of
<em>jNetPcap</em>
.
