                                 Change Log

== Release 1.4.r14??  (2015-?-?) ==

* Note: this change log is in preparation for a release. The files have
	not been released yet as of 2015-2-7.

	- Added *_STRUCT_LENGTH macro for all protocols
	
	- Added *_CALC_LENGTH(p) macro for all protocols with variable header
		length which calculates the actual length of the header
		
	- In many cases allows both struct bit-field access as well 
		as byte-aligned non bit-field access to all protocol structures	                    
		                
== Release 1.3.b4  (2010-12-15) ==

* Fixes

	- Memory swings - Object finalization is replaced with java Reference 
	               cleanup. Memory is now managed through Reference and 
	               ReferenceQueue mechanism. 
	              
	
	- Various performance optimizations in JMemory and JBuffer class. Optimized
	               memory allocation path in JMemoryPool for certain object
	               types.  
	               
	- Fixed boundary check in Checksum calculation with truncated jumbo
	               Ethernet frames.
	               
	- Fixed an issue when an JMemory based object tried to peer to itself.
	
	- Fixed JMemory resize issue.
	
	- Fixed Bug#3108615 - Ethernet FCS - FCS calculation and various Ethernet 
	               header APIs that check for presence of FCS field, allow 
	               verification, calculation and setting of new FCS value.
	
	
* Added

	- Added a new  management class named DisposableGC which runs in 
	               a background system thread and schedules native memory 
	               cleanup. 
	               
	- Added several system properties (nio.mx, nio.ms, nio.blocksize) which 
	               affect native memory allocation, limits and DisposableGC 
	               behavior.

	- PcapPacket.peerAndScan - convenience method peering header and buffer
	               to a PcapPacket object. Implements certain optimizations
	               to perform the task faster.
	               
	               
* Changes

    - Changed the format of the debug output for 
                   PcapPacket.State.toDebugString() method. The output produced
                   is more tabular with a table heading on top.	      
                   
    - Removed no longer used classes and directories from source such as
                   tests/beta1.5, JReference class, JMemory.references field         
	               
* Non-code changes

    - Added complete MANIFEST to jnetpcap.jar file, which describes version
                   information of the jNetPcap library being used.

    - Changed the native and java library files names to not include full
                   version information. The versioning is now fully accomplished
                   through the use of jnetpcap root distribution directory
                   instead. This allows easier switching between different
                   versions of jNetPcap.

	- Updated file headers which reflects the proper copyright and license
	               agreement (LGPL v3)
	               
	- Updated all javadoc comments and tags for all classes

== Release 1.2.rc3 (2008-12-22) ==

* Update to 1.2.rc2

* Fixes

  - #2458371 - Serious memory leak in JMemory
  
  - #2458376 - Invalid class name for an exception being thrown from JNI code
  
* Added

  - Protocol to protocol binding and registration
  
  - Protocol header annotations; makes protocol definitions much cleaner and 
    easier to write
    
  - Protocols/java directory with some - new non core protocols being released;
    Http and Html headers are included
    
  - Added several static methods to JMemory class which report on native memory
    usage for jNetPcap library; since native memory is not reported in any JRE
    statictics, the user can rely on these JMemory methods for monitoring
    native memory usage
    
  - Added several getter methods to JBuffer class that retrieve UTF8 strings in
    raw buffers
    
* Changes

  - Main JNI scanner LOOP has been slightly rewritten to take advantage of
    JHeaderScanner java objects, their bidnings and user written scanners
    
* TODO
    
  - JField class still needs more cleanup; JFieldRuntime needs to be removed
    completely
    
  - Formatting styles for field values need to be redone; currently too limited
    in functionality
    
  - Add exception hooks; exception hooks rewrite exceptions being thrown to
    include a lot more debug information that is useful when debugging a 
    protocol

  - #2321017 - Deprecate: PcapInteger
  
  - #2321024 - Deprecate: certain loop, dispatch functions  

* Bugs

  - #2219738 - WinPcap.sendQueue ignores its parameter.  
               WinPcapSendQueue(int size) constructor was ignoring size 
               parameter and using a constant.
    
  - #2219729 - Memory leak in Pcap.loop().
               Memory leak in Pcap.loop method. Local JNI references were 
               accumulating causing out of memory errors in Pcap.loop when it 
               was set to loop forever.
                                 
== Release 1.1 (2008-06-19) ==

* Maintenance release

* Provides packages for: Fedora Core 8 (Linux), Debian 4 (Linux), Win32 (WinXP/Vista)

* NO BUG FIXES - no bugs reported from the time of previous release
                                 
== Release 1.0 (2007-12-21) ==

* First production release

* Bug #1855589 - Win32 isInjectSupported returned incorrect value 

== Release 1.0b4 (2007-08-21) ==

* Linux support

* Bug #1776380 - PcapBpfProgram exceptions on linux platform

* Added

  - Pcap.inject, Pcap.isSendPacketSupported, Pcap.isInjectPacketSupported,
    Pcap.lookupDev, Pcap.lookupNet
                                 
== Release 1.0b3 ==

* No bugs found or reported since previous release

* Additions to org.jnetpcap package
  
  - All core 'libpcap' functions
    
  - PcapClosedException, PcapExtensionNotAvailableException exceptions

* Addtions of and to jnetpcap.org.winpcap package - WinPcap extensions
  
    + Nearly all WinPcap based functions, very few exceptions

* Removed "commons-logging" dependency. Static initializers throw appropriate 
  exceptions directly during initialization failure.

== Release 1.0b2 ==

* Bug #1767744  - PcapHandler object ptr error in loop() and dispatch()
                  This is a critical bug, where PcapHandler objects clobers the
                  parent Pcap object data after invocation through loop() or
                  dispatch() method.
                 
* Add a number of int constants to Pcap.java class to represent various return
  codes, flags, and mode settings. Each constant has detailed explanation of
  its usage and where it is be applicable.
  
* openLive() method will now also return "warning" messages in errbuf, even if
  result code from the OK was 0, meaning no error had occured, as per pcap 
  specification.
  
* Possible issue uncovered, but not fixed in this release.

  - setting the snaplen value on openLinve() call does not seem to cause a 
    return of a truncated packet buffer from next(), nextEx(), dispatch() or 
    loop(). The buffer always contains the entire packet. Significant
    debugging effort does not point to a bug in jNetPcap software but in
    underlying WinPcap library. This could be in issue with particular Network
    Interface Card in use. The issue is still under investigation, but the fix 
    to critical bug #1767744 can not be delayed.
    
== Release 1.0b1 ==

* Initial release
