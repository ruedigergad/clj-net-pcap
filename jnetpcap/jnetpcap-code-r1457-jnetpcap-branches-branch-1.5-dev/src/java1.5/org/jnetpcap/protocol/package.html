Network protocols and header definitions.
<p>This package provides a set of core protocols provided by
jNetPcap. A protocol is made up of a mandatory header class and optional
analysis and other support classes. Analysis classes called
analyzers monitor stream of incoming packets, events from other
analyzers while performing required buffering if necessary, in order to
produce analyzer output.</p>
<p>Analyzer output can be attached directly to packets or streams as
well as dispatched to analyzer listeners directly.</p>
