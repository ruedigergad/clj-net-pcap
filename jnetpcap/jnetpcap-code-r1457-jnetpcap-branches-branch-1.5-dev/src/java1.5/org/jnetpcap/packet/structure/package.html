Packet, Header, Field, Binding and Scanner primitives that describe their
structure. The classes in this package are used to describe the static structure
of packet elements. These primitive description objects are used to build templates
of those packet components. Some of those templates are stored in JRegistry and
others are hierarchaly built into other parent templates. Real objects such as
JHeader basec objects use these templates to build themselves and generate fields
and sub headers. So do bindings and java header scanners.
